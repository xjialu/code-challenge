# Switcheo Code Challenge Submission

This repository contains my solutions to the Switcheo Code Challenge problems.

## Solutions Overview

### Problem 1: Sum to N

- File: `q1.js`
- Implementation of three different approaches to calculate sum from 1 to n:
  - Mathematical formula: O(1) time complexity
  - Recursive approach
  - Iterative approach

### Problem 2: Fancy Form

- File: `fancyform`
- A React-based form implementation with validation and styling

### Problem 3: Wallet Integration

- File: `q3.edited.ts`
